 Hello, coder!
 
 Do you ever heard [Machine Learning](glossary://machine learning)? If you feel strange about that, let's just see how they can help us!
 
 Firstly, you can pick a color you want to use. Just click the colorful buttons!
 
 Then, you can use your finger or Apple Pencil write a digit in the right canvas! For example, you can write 0 to 4.(Because of the time and size limited, I just trained hundreds of 0 to 4 digits.)
 
 After you wrote, wait a little while, the result will appear!
 
 Does it recognize correctly what you write?
 
 It's doesn't matter that it guess wrong, because it's still young. It should **pratice** more, then it'll become more powerfull! Let's think how to make it!
 
 1. We need to some data to train the model. If we want our machine to get things done, firstly it should know what is the thing. So we need some data to train it. Like this example, there is a famous data name [MNIST](glossary://mnist) for handwriting digits. But I don't use it here. I use my iPad to collect my data.
 2. We need to train the model. Thanks to Apple's new open-source project, TuriCreate, we can easily train our model. Just like many other frameworks of machine learning, we should use Python to train the model. I will open-source my model & train data on GitHub. (So we need to be trained also. ðŸ˜„)
 3. Export the model to CoreML format. The TuriCreate is powered by Apple. So it just one line of code to export our model to CoreML format.
 4. Add the model in our project. Thanks to simple APIs of CoreML, it's easy to learn from it.
 
 With just 4 steps, we can easily build machine learning app by ourself! It's really easy & powerful!
 
 I know somebody is interest with AR, let's see a surpise in next page!
